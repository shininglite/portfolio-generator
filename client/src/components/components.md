# components Folder

Welcome to the components folder. This document is going to describe all the folders/files in the components directory. This is one of many different architectures you can use when building any application.

The components folder is stores all your "dumb" aka "Container Components" aka "Stateless" components. These should be components that just take props. This would be a buttons, navbar, cards, etc. that just rendered to the screen.

This should be the look and feel of the site.

This takes in whatever props it needs to render the component.
