### Description
Portfolio Generator is a React app that automatically creates a curated portfolio from a developer's GitHub projects. The portfolio is presented in a standardized format for potential employers, or others, to view. 

### Why Use Portfolio Generator
Developers have limited time to devote to creating an attractive way to display their projects. Developers typically have multiple projects under construction, and may not wish to include all of them in their portfolio. Portfolio Generator was created to automatically produce a professional project portfolio.

### How Portfolio Generator Works
This application allows a developer to retrieve their GitHub projects and select any, or all, of those to automatically create an attractive portfolio.

### Technologies Used
Profile Generator is a full-stack application, using client side and server side technologies. Client side technologies used include HTML (hypertext markup language), CSS (cascading style sheets) and the JavaScript programming. Server side technologies used are Express, Node, and MongoDB. We chose to use the MERN stack of open source software.

#### MERN Stack
The MERN stack is:

<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">Mongo DB</a>, a popular server-side database.

<a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html">Express JS</a>, a minimalist web framework that provides features for developing web and mobile applications.

<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React JS</a>, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node JS</a>, server-side JavaScript built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

#### Libraries
Portfolio Generator uses:

<a href="https://react.semantic-ui.com/">React Semantic UI</a>, a modern front-end development framework, powered by

<a href="https://lesscss.org/">Less CSS</a> which stands for Leaner Style Sheets. Less CSS is a backwards-compatible language extension for CSS

<a href="https://https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React Bootstrap</a> is a client-side CSS library rebuilt with true React components without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.

### Developer Installation Steps
- install mongoDB
- install node.js
- install google chrome browser

- copy the command that is now below that button (`git@github.com:shininglite/portfolio-generator.git`)
- cd to the folder where you have your projects on your local machine
- type "`git clone git@github.com:shininglite/portfolio-generator.git`"
- cd to portfolio-generator folder that was just created with the above command
- type "`npm install`" to create a package.json file
- cd to client directory and type "npm install"

### Usage 

#### Getting Started
The first time you type "`npm start`" you will be prompted to enter your GitHub username.

#### Welcome Screen

Enter your GitHub user name and choose OK

#### Create Account or Sign In
You are then prompted to create an account (or sign in if you have already created an account). An account is needed so that your GitHub username is retained in the Mongo database. The database retains your curated list of projects to publish to your portfolio.

#### Portfolio List
Once you have created an account or signed in, you will see a list of your GitHub projects (repositories). Click the project row, or rows, that you want to activate. Activated projects will appear in your final portfolio.
